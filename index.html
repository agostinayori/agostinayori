    <h2>🎮 Why do I keep coming back to Dark Souls?</h2>
    <p>I don’t know if it’s the haunting atmosphere, the thrill of beating a boss that once felt impossible, the satisfaction of overcoming frustration, or just me getting attached to pain and calling it nostalgia. But anyway, FromSoft games became a weird kind of anchor during a strange season of my life, and I probably owe them more than I’d like to admit. People underestimate video games way too often, when in reality they’re a pretty underrated form of therapy, growth, storytelling, and connection</p>

    This one hit a nerve. I’m not religious (I used to be, but somehow escaped the echo chamber), but I treat truth like some kind of salvation, the ultimate goal. Turns out obsessing over what’s real and what it's not, can mess you up just as much as blindly believing something. Still, I think it’s worth it. A reminder that it’s okay to admit I don’t know what tf I’m doing.

  <h2>👽 The Singularity: A Reminder I Know Nothing</h2>
  <p>
    I stumbled onto this fascinating paper after spending a year living abroad where suddenly everyone talks about AI like it’s just weather or sports. Back home in Argentina I didn’t know anyone casually dropping terms like “recursive self-improvement” over dinner. I barely know what half of it means, but the existential weight of it sticks anyway. I'd love to learn more (hopefully a bit more technical) to actually grasp the implications and to be terrified (or excited) for the right reasons. Until then, I’ll just be nodding at tech bros like I didn’t just ask what an attention mechanism actually pays attention to.

  <h2>Romance for NPCs and Bayesian Overthinkers Alike</h2>

  <p>Recent experiences and connections have made me realize that one of the weirdest assumptions we make is that other people experience the world kind of like we do. <em>Cognitive science 101:</em> perception is a Bayesian inference engine. Translation? The brain predicts reality, not just reads it. It's basically a pattern-matching machine on the hunt for shortcuts. It fills gaps with whatever we would’ve done, which is cute but scientifically garbage.</p>

  <p>When expectations misalign, we label that mismatch “cold”, “clingy”, or my personal favorite “emotionally unavailable”. We kind of use our own internal manual to guess what's going on in a system we've never operated. People don’t just express emotions differently, they perceive them on entirely different wavelengths. Cross-cultural labs have found that a simple smile can map to anything from polite discomfort to open flirtation, depending on postal code. Good luck out there.</p>

  <p>Picture two friends watching Netflix: one hears silence as comfy bonding, the other as “Am I boring you?” (PS: I’ve been both of those...). Same couch, different universes.</p>

  <p>So how do we translate our emotions into something the other person can even pick up? And how do we learn to decode theirs? How do we stop mistaking “lost in translation” for apathy? Or most importantly, how do we stop convincing ourselves the latter is merely “complex” affection?</p>

  <p>First patch could be to quit autocompleting the other person’s inner monologue with our own script. Collect more data points before publishing our thesis… And maybe —wild idea— ask. (Small hack: swap “Why are you like this?” for “What does that mean for you?”)</p>

  <p>Best case scenario, you two become bilingual in each other’s weirdness. Worst case, you confirm they’re basically an NPC and you can head off for snacks guiltfree.</p>

  <h2>ChatGPT, describe my personality. Clinical tone, minimal drama:</h2>
  <p>
    Suspicious of certainty, allergic to small talk, and constantly toggling between logic and longing.
    Exhibits strong pattern recognition, but struggles with emotional ambiguity—especially in relationships.
    Analytical by nature, emotional by default. One side craves logic, patterns, explanations; the other gets caught in feelings too big to name.
    Displays high verbal intelligence, dry humor, skepticism, and a persistent inner critic that both drives improvement and fuels self-doubt.
    Navigates the world through deep curiosity, observation, intuition, and a growing discomfort with superficiality.
    There’s depth behind her irony, warmth under her wit, and an honest vulnerability she shares with just enough humor to stay in control.
    Unresolved by design, like most of her favorite questions.
