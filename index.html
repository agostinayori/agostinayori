  <h2>Writing About Writing About It</h2>
  <p>An honest review of a book I didn’t manage to write about.</p>

  <p>Just finished this book called If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, one of those cheerful titles about AI doom, alignment, engineering problems, and our collective inability to stop inventing things that might delete us.
It’s a pretty bleak book. I’m not particularly fond of apocalyptic or conspiratorial takes on anything, but I guess the only sensible move is to read both prophets and skeptics, and then form a moderately informed opinion of your own.
I thought it deserved a post. Not precisely for the reasons one might expect though.</p>

  <p>I’ve realized (well, I’ve probably known for a while but only recently decided to admit it out loud) that simply consuming content (reading, listening, watching) doesn’t actually make that information accessible when someone brings it up in conversation. The data’s somewhere in storage, but good luck retrieving it under social pressure.
That, I assume, is the quiet existential crisis of every curious mind: realizing you’ve read half the internet and retained just enough to sound vaguely informed until someone asks a follow up question.
At that point, you either improvise confidently or redirect the conversation to something safer, like the weather or late stage capitalism. </p>

  <p>In that regard, you need to get your knowledge, curiosity, and self-awareness to cooperate long enough to form a coherent sentence. Which in my case usually takes several drafts.</p>

  <p>So yes, you have to take one step further and talk about it (or, as any introvert would argue, write it). Even if it’s nowhere near technical. Especially then.
By now I’m not even writing about the book. I’m writing about the process of trying to write about it, which is probably the most honest review I could give.
Also a decent glimpse into the 24/7 nightmare I call the pivoting brain. And no, there’s no known cure. Though I’ve heard exercise helps, which sounds suspiciously like propaganda.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I wonder if curiosity is something we chase for its own sake or because we want to be the person who can keep a conversation alive. Probably both. It feels like a reliable measure of compatibility. How willing are you to stay in a permanent learning state about how everything works, including yourself? And how often do you actually change your mind when faced with new evidence? Asking for everyone.</p>

  <p>Everyone seems to be chasing specialization. That holy state of knowing one thing so deeply that the rest of the world blurs out.
I hope that happens to me someday too. But I have to admit, chasing the “jack of all trades, master of none” path feels valuable as well.
The ones who can finish the sentence know why.</p>

  <h2>Faith in the Age of Measurement</h2>
  <p>I know I keep coming back to this, but I have this really close friend, she’s an engineer. We only see each other once or twice a year, and every time we do, our conversations drift in the same direction: she’s diving deeper into chakras, “human design”, energy, tarot, astrology, and of course, religion. I couldn’t possibly stress enough that this is not a judgment, although my way of expressing it almost always makes it look that way.</p>

  <p>It’s just that every time I leave her, I’m left with the same question:
  How can someone educated in such beautifully measurable and, as far as possible, accurate fields as engineering, so deeply believe in what I can’t help but think of as magic? What could be missing from the real, observable world that makes people feel such a strong need to look for it in the imaginary?</p>

  <p>I’ve always tried to be open-minded, something I guess I’ll always be fine-tuning, but this is the one domain where I never quite succeed. Despite how endlessly fascinating reality already is, filled with things to learn and marvel at, I still can’t understand why some people look past it in search of another kind of truth.</p>

  <p>How can they live with the idea that what they believe in is just as likely to be wrong as it is to be true? The more we understand about the universe, the more people seem to crave something that refuses to be understood.</p>

  <p>I just keep wondering if my skepticism makes me blind to something they can actually feel, or if they’re simply soothing a void that I learned to stare at directly.</p>

  <p>I always tell myself, and those friends, as a way to meet halfway that as long as a belief helps you grow in some constructive way, its factual truth might be secondary. Still, the question of why such beliefs are so praised only grows louder in me.</p>

    <h2>🎮 Why do I keep coming back to Dark Souls?</h2>
    <p>I don’t know if it’s the haunting atmosphere, the thrill of beating a boss that once felt impossible, the satisfaction of overcoming frustration, or just me getting attached to pain and calling it nostalgia. But anyway, FromSoft games became a weird kind of anchor during a strange season of my life, and I probably owe them more than I’d like to admit. People underestimate video games way too often, when in reality they’re a pretty underrated form of therapy, growth, storytelling, and connection</p>

    This one hit a nerve. I’m not religious (I used to be, but somehow escaped the echo chamber), but I treat truth like some kind of salvation, the ultimate goal. Turns out obsessing over what’s real and what it's not, can mess you up just as much as blindly believing something. Still, I think it’s worth it. A reminder that it’s okay to admit I don’t know what tf I’m doing.

  <h2>👽 The Singularity: A Reminder I Know Nothing</h2>
  <p>
    I stumbled onto this fascinating paper after spending a year living abroad where suddenly everyone talks about AI like it’s just weather or sports. Back home in Argentina I didn’t know anyone casually dropping terms like “recursive self-improvement” over dinner. I barely know what half of it means, but the existential weight of it sticks anyway. I'd love to learn more (hopefully a bit more technical) to actually grasp the implications and to be terrified (or excited) for the right reasons. Until then, I’ll just be nodding at tech bros like I didn’t just ask what an attention mechanism actually pays attention to.

  <h2>Emotions for NPCs and Bayesian Overthinkers Alike</h2>

  <p>Recent experiences and connections have made me realize that one of the weirdest assumptions we make is that other people experience the world kind of like we do. <em>Cognitive science 101:</em> perception is a Bayesian inference engine. Translation? The brain predicts reality, not just reads it. It's basically a pattern-matching machine on the hunt for shortcuts. It fills gaps with whatever we would’ve done, which is cute but scientifically garbage.</p>

  <p>When expectations misalign, we label that mismatch “cold”, “clingy”, or my personal favorite “emotionally unavailable”. We kind of use our own internal manual to guess what's going on in a system we've never operated. People don’t just express emotions differently, they perceive them on entirely different wavelengths. Cross-cultural labs have found that a simple smile can map to anything from polite discomfort to open flirtation, depending on postal code. Good luck out there.</p>

  <p>Picture two friends watching Netflix: one hears silence as comfy bonding, the other as “Am I boring you?” (PS: I’ve been both of those...). Same couch, different universes.</p>

  <p>So how do we translate our emotions into something the other person can even pick up? And how do we learn to decode theirs? How do we stop mistaking “lost in translation” for apathy? Or most importantly, how do we stop convincing ourselves the latter is merely “complex” affection?</p>

  <p>First patch could be to quit autocompleting the other person’s inner monologue with our own script. Collect more data points before publishing our thesis… And maybe —wild idea— ask. (Small hack: swap “Why are you like this?” for “What does that mean for you?”)</p>

  <p>Best case scenario, you two become bilingual in each other’s weirdness. Worst case, you confirm they’re basically an NPC and you can head off for snacks guiltfree.</p>

  <h2>ChatGPT, describe my personality. Clinical tone, minimal drama:</h2>
  <p>
    Suspicious of certainty, allergic to small talk, and constantly toggling between logic and longing.
    Exhibits strong pattern recognition, but struggles with emotional ambiguity—especially in relationships.
    Analytical by nature, emotional by default. One side craves logic, patterns, explanations; the other gets caught in feelings too big to name.
    Displays high verbal intelligence, dry humor, skepticism, and a persistent inner critic that both drives improvement and fuels self-doubt.
    Navigates the world through deep curiosity, observation, intuition, and a growing discomfort with superficiality.
    There’s depth behind her irony, warmth under her wit, and an honest vulnerability she shares with just enough humor to stay in control.
    Unresolved by design, like most of her favorite questions.
